Note:
1. Code is extremely bad. I prioritized getting everything done in time over clean code. There are a lot of unnecessary lines that are never used. For example, the QuantityInput component doesn't referene the passed in props anymore. Instead, the order is accessed through session storage because I wanted an easy way to maintain the order of the items when the user is entering them. Before, all of the items were displayed through the ordering of the menu, but this made it difficult to double check an order and making sure we have everything.
2. As of right now, you can only save an order once. This means that once you make an update after pressing "save order", you cannot resave the order and therefore updates cannot be made. Also, the save order button turns into "SAVED" once pressed. Pressing "clear" after it becomes "saved" will clear the session storage and thus getting rid of the order, but the "saved" button will remain the same
3. As I said above, the code is not meant to be clean since I prioritized getting things done and working. There are a lot of useless methods and a lot of methods that are way too big because they contain all of the mechanisms to get things working
